**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/IT Professional/Systems Administrator)`**

I'm an indie developer and IT Professional currently working as a Systems Administrator, I'm just building my idea of the digital world one step at a time. All my coding projects are built from the ground up, I plan and design my projects with the intention of showcasing them to followers and potential employers with the intention of one day turning my programming hobby into a dream job üíÅüí≠. At first I'm going to share some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript projects and progressively advance to solving real-life problems with code. You can find out more about me on my LinkedIn page "[Conor Maher][LinkedIn]" and on my portfolio website "[Marcey14]".

 <summary><h3>üåé Conor's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I started my coding journey in my college dorm as an Engineering Student in 2014 when I asked a friend of mine to show me an application he was building. He showed me how simple it was to build a webpage usig HTML and CSS and before I knew it I was watching Youtube videos from a channel called "The New Boston" and doing online courses from MIT-Open-courseware, CS50, Coursera and Udemy to name a few, after I passed my first year exams in 2015 I realised I spent more time coding than I did in my engineering course so I deferred my course for a year. In 2016 I joined a Computer Science course where I studied C Programming, Web Development Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Operating Systems, (Windows, Mac, Linux and OS theory), "Maths", "Communications", "microprocessors", "Cryptography" to name a few.
   
In 2018 I left college with no degree and became a Junior IT Support Engineer for an MSP company called Lantech, here I learned a lot about how systems, applications and devices work in a corporate environment. In 2019 I was made a level 1 IT Support Engineer and sent onsite to a client of ours to be their help desk Engineer. I gained invaluable experience here in a very high paced environment and in 2021 I joined another MSP called Infinite Technologies as a Service Desk Analyst, here I learend a lot about virtual environments and cloud technologies such as Microsoft Azure. I was soon sent permanently to a client of ours again to be their permanent onsite Systems Analyst and progressed very quickly. 

In 2022 I received a job offer for an in-house Service Desk Administrator for Allied World Assurance Company, cutting out the middle man (the MSP) meant a higher wage that my company was unwilling to pay and provided better opportunities for groowth so I left on good terms to persue my next chapter. Here I carried out the duties of a Service Desk Engineer and a Sytems Administrator, during the course of my career I had used scripting languages such as python, powershelL, bash, etc for automation and had been exposed to linux systems also, here I built on those skills and also learned about R.

I worked as a Service Desk Administrator until August 2024, when I handed in my notice to move to Heidelberg, Germany as my girlfriend is from there. Although I enjoyed my role as a Service Desk Administrator I remember what got me into the IT field in the first place which was web development, I often build web applications as a hobby in my spare time and find myself doing online courses for various programming languages so I figured why not go all out and try to turn a hobby into a job seeing as I am starting fresh in a new country as it is.
